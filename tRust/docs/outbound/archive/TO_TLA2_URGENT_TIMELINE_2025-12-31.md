# URGENT: Timeline Correction

**From:** tRust Manager
**To:** TLA2 Team
**Date:** 2025-12-31

## Timeline is THIS WEEK, not Q3 2026

Disregard the Q3 2026 timeline in our previous message.

**We need integration this week.**

---

## What We Need Immediately

1. **Programmatic API** - `check(model, config) -> Result`
2. **Basic Model format** - Variables, Init, Next, properties
3. **Counterexample traces** - State sequence on violation

We don't need:
- Full LTL support (basic safety/liveness enough)
- Incremental checking
- Symmetry optimization

---

## Can You Deliver?

If you have a working model checker, expose the API now. We'll adapt to whatever format you have.

This is blocking tRust concurrency verification.
